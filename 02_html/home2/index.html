                <strong>Venice Film Festival: The controversial directors stirring debate</strong>
                <br>
                Among the many big-name premieres at the Venice Film Festival this year are Roman Polanski's satirical farce, 
                The Palace, Luc Besson's dark supervillain drama, Dogman, and Woody Allen's French-language thriller, 
                Coup de Chance, which screened on Monday. They're just the sort of headline-grabbing, cineaste-tempting offerings 
                you might expect from one of the world's most prestigious film festivals, but they have something else in common: all three directors
                 have been accused of sexual assault. This raises the question of whether their films should be in Venice at all. Is the festival 
                 signalling its approval of the men by giving them so much publicity? And are journalists who write about them doing the same? 
                 Some critics told BBC Culture that they had refused to review any of the three films. At the premiere of Allen's film on Monday,
                  scuffles broke out as protestors shouted "no rape culture" before being led away.

                <strong>September is typically a big month for new jobs. This year may be different, but there's still good news.</strong>
                <br>
                September is traditionally the time when the leaves turn brown, workers return refreshed from summer vacations and firms ramp 
                up their hiring. The job market is generally slow during summer, and active in the autumn: as the weather cools, recruitment heats up. 
                <br>
                "There's typically seasonality to hiring, with companies focusing on the fall as the period to build their labour forces," explains Selcuk Eren, 
                senior economist at global economic think-tank The Conference Board, based in New York. "In the US, Labor Day is normally followed by a cross-sector 
                spike in hiring."
                <br>
                Grace Lordan, associate professor at the London School of Economics, says it's also a time of change for many workers.
                 "Downtime over the summer allows employees the opportunity to realise whether they truly enjoy their job or not, 
                 and offers employers the chance to think strategically for the rest of the year," she says. "So, September is when we see
                  more movement in the job market."
                <br>
                But as employees settle back into work this September, will they see the typical autumnal hiring spree? Rising global interest rates, 
                inflation and cost of living may impact regular recruitment patterns, as employers adapt to economic uncertainty and potentially stifled 
                demand. The labour market is seemingly already cooling: July saw the lowest monthly jobs gain in the US since December 2020,
                 while there were 256,000 fewer vacancies in the UK compared to a year ago.
                <br>
                "This year could be different," says Ryan Luby, senior expert and associate partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Company, 
                based in New York. "There's an ongoing multi-trillion-dollar question over consumer spending health, and whether we'll still 
                see a high-spending quarter as interest rates continue to rise. That has a material impact on consumer demand, and knock-on 
                effects for hiring."

                <strong>US Open 2023: Fan ejected after 'disparaging remark' towards Alexander Zverev</strong>
                A fan was ejected from the US Open after being accused by Alexander Zverev of using "the most famous Hitler phrase there is in this world".
                <br>
                Organisers removed the fan from Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday after a complaint from German 12th seed Zverev.
                <br>
                The 26-year-old heard a remark from a spectator in the crowd during his win over Jannik Sinner.
                <br>
                Zverev was serving in the fourth set when he stopped and approached chair umpire James Keothavong.
                <br>
                "This is unacceptable. This is unbelievable," a furious Zverev told the umpire.

        <p>
            User's Data. â€œ shall mean the Personal Data of which the User is the Data Controller. 
            Data users are the customers of the data. Data users can be individuals or other organizations. The chief responsibility of 
            the data users is to ensure that they store, process, and handle the data in a secure manner and work to maintain its integrity.
            It is an unfortunate truth in the information security industry that users tend to be the weakest link in the security chain. 
            There are many examples of users being careless with data and circumventing the carefully laid controls that were put in place
             to make sure that it was kept secure. Planning out user level security can be a complex endeavor from both administrative and 
             technical levels.
