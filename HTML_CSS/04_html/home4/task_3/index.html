        When Smashing Magazine approached Netlify, they managed a dizzying number of tools across different functional areas of
        their site including their magazine, content, e-commerce platform, comments engine, subscription service and member
        login.

        <ol>
          <li>
            6x their site speed, from a load time of 800 ms to just 80 ms
          </li>
          <li>
            Migrate from several disparate tools to a single unified platform
          </li>
          <li>
            Build a design they loved without the limitations of WordPress
          </li>

            Develop the most performant site possible with a focus on reliability and speed.
