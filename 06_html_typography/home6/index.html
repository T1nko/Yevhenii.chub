          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
          <span class="underline">their own section</span>. Continue reading for
          an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and

        <div class="chapter">Chapter 2</div>
        <p class="paragraph">
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
          React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
          well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
          components:
          <span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You
          can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover
          how components work in React Native.

        <div class="title">REACT FUNDAMENTALS</div>
        <div class="chapter">Chapter 3</div>
        <p class="paragraph">
          React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular
          open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
          make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
          This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph before">
          <span class="bold">components.</span> The rest of this introduction to
          React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
          need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph before">
          <span class="bold">JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a
          syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like
          <span class="bg_gray">
            &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The React docs have
          <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
          variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
          <span class="bg_gray">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it
          with curly braces inside
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph before">
          <span class="bold">props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph before">
          <span class="bold">state.</span> While you can think of props as
          arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a
          component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
          that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
          gives your components memory!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="article">
        <div class="title">HANDLING TEXT INPUT</div>
        <div class="chapter">Chapter 4</div>
        <p class="paragraph">
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
          function to be called every time the text changed, and an
          onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text
          is submitted.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this new language, every
          single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
